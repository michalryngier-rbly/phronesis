          We could not create an order with <v-code>Recomm</v-code> and shipping rate calculation by Rebilly selected
          - delivery address didn't pass validation. Trying to do it via Postman with different tweaks also sis not work.
          We tried everything: changing the address, changing the country, etc.

          We could not change the shipping rate on existing invoices as well. It was possible to add a line with our "Books" product
          and it even enable the shipping on the invoice, but the shipping price was 0 CAD despite fulfilling the conditions for paid shipping.
          We tried everything here as well: changing addresses (billing and delivery), changing the country, etc.
