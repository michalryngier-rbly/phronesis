          title="Risk score factor does not trigger with high values"
        >
          We set risk score factor to between 5 and 99999, and it did not trigger. When we changed it to between 5 and 1000, it did trigger.

          <p>To reproduce:</p>
          <ol class="ml-6">
            <li>Go to 'Update risk score settings'</li>
            <li>Select 'Add new risk factor'</li>
            <li>Select 'Customer lifetime value' or any other</li>
            <li>Set 'is between' to 5 and 99999</li>
            <li>Make a payment which meets the risk factor</li>
            <li>See it did not trigger</li>

          Risk score on transaction is not always displayed properly - sometimes it says 0 and sometimes value is correctly displayed. We refreshed the page and it was sometimes 0 and sometimes it was correct.

          There are two 'refresh' buttons on risk score simulation modal. It is not clear what they do, especially when there is no data loaded yet.

          title="Seconds have to be used to determine block duration"
        >
          We were confused about why we need to use seconds. Might be nice to add dropdown with unit options.

          <p>To reproduce:</p>
          <ol class="ml-6">
            <li>Go to 'Update risk score settings'</li>
            <li>See block duration input</li>

          title="No â€˜clear inputâ€™ button for Threshold button"
        >
          Threshold input has no â€˜clear inputâ€™ button, which is confusing. It would be nice to have one.

          <p>To reproduce:</p>
          <ol class="ml-6">
            <li>Go to 'Update risk score settings'</li>
            <li>See threshold input</li>

          confusing
          title="No direct way to set inf value for in between value"
        >
          We were confused how we should set 'more than X' value for in between value. We couldn't leave the second value empty, so we had to set it to a very high number, which is not intuitive, especially when risk factor was about the lifetime value.

          <p>To reproduce:</p>
          <ol class="ml-6">
            <li>Go to 'Update risk score settings'</li>
            <li>Select 'Add new risk factor'</li>
            <li>Select 'Customer lifetime value'</li>
            <li>Confused about what should be set for the second value</li>
          </ol>

          Would be nice to have a spinner when running risk score simulation, so we know that something is happening.

          <p>To reproduce:</p>
          <ol class="ml-6">
            <li>Go to 'Update risk score settings</li>
            <li>Click on 'Run simulation'</li>
            <li>In modal click on 'Run simulation'</li>
            <li>See list empty state where spinner would be a better fit</li>
          </ol>
