          â€˜Something went wrongâ€™ after the KYC - no option to 'Try again', 'Contact support'. Would be good to handle
          errors with an option to go back and try again.<br>

          Even though we had â€˜Has matching face proofâ€™ failed and the score was not updated. It was not present in the list of checks. We should be more transparent about checks we run in every verification level.
          <br>
          Should we list the features that are verified? We set 'Has matching face proof' weight to 65 but it wasnâ€™t taken into account in the â€˜Moderateâ€™ level.

          It happens with no clear cause or trigger and we have no related API Error log. It simply blocks our KYC
