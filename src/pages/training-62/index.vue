          issue

          An invalid CVV (000) was saved. After refreshing the page and proceeding to payment, the invalid CVV was still stored and used. Additionally, when an invalid CVV is stored and a deposit is attempted, the card icon appears broken.

          <p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong></p>
          <ol class="ml-6">
            <li>Make an approved transaction.</li>
            <li>Go to "Manage" on the previously saved payment method.</li>
            <li>Input invalid CVV (000) and check "Save CVV".</li>
            <li>Refresh the page.</li>
            <li>Try to use the same payment method.</li>
            <li>Proceed with deposit.</li>
            <li>See error and broken card icon.</li>

          When updating a payment method, we could not enter "10/51". Focusing on "01" and pressing "1" did not change the value. To update, we had to remove everything and then type the new value.

          issue

        >
          When performing a reverse withdrawal, the value is not validated on the frontend for the minimum deposit amount.

          The minimum withdrawal is validated, so users cannot withdraw less than $50. However, the minimum deposit (reverse withdrawal) is not validated by FE validation. The server error is displayed only after submitting the form and is not descriptive enough.

          The CVV field is highlighted in red during frontend validation, but does not show an error state when there are server errors. Also, errors have different messages for frontend and backend validations.

          When a server error occurs for the expiration date or CVV, the cursor position is set to the last active position. We suggest focusing the entire input same as when we use Tab to navigate between inputs.

          Having non-clickable withdrawal methods is confusing. We should remove them when there are insufficient funds to withdraw and display only the available withdrawal methods in a disabled state.

          This type of message seems appropriate only for a welcome bonus, but should not be applied globally to any bonus, such as a birthday bonus or other types that should not be lost. There should be a flag, such as ‚Äòreset-on-withdraw‚Äô, for bonuses where this behavior is intended.
